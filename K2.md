# Granular Sampling (2)

### Click Noise
Click noise is a short, transient sound artifact caused by sudden signal discontinuities, such as digital errors, sample dropouts, or **abrupt waveform changes** in audio processing.

### Windowing

In granular sampling, a [windowing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function) shapes individual grains by smoothly fading them in and out. This prevents abrupt amplitude changes, reducing artifacts like clicks. Different window shapes (e.g., Sine, Hann, Gaussian) affect the grainâ€™s timbre and smoothness.

### [cos~]
This object outputs a cosine curve based on the incoming signal.

### Assignment 1:
Generate a sine window using [phasor~ 400] and [cos~].

### Assignment 2:
Download the [K1 Assignment 8](K1/a8.maxpat) patch. 
Remove click noise by syncing [phasor~] and [cos~].

### Assignment 3:
The click noise is now removed from the grain playback, but the click noise can still be heard when we change the playback position with the slider. Explain why.

### [sah~]
The sample and hold object captures one audio sample in the incoming signal to the left inlet when the control signal exceeds the threshold value given as the argument and keeps outputting that captured sample until the control signal exceeds the threshold next time.

### Assignment 4:
Using the [sah~] object in the patch, avoid the click noise when the playback position is changed by the slider.

### Assignment 5:
Based on the patch for Assignment 4, add one more slider (range 0-100) to the patch and change the pitch of grains with the slider. In this assignment, it is acceptable to generate click noise when the pitch is changed.

### Assignment 6:
Apply the technique used for Assignment 4 to avoid click noise when changing the pitch of the grain.

### Assignment 7:
Add a keyboard to the patch that enables the user to transpose the grain pitch by pressing a key, using A4 as the original pitch.

For example, if the user presses the C5 key, the pitch should be shifted by a minor third.

### Assginemtn 8:
combine the idea of Assignment 7 with [itable] and play a melodic pattern using granular sampling.

### Assignment 9:
Duplicate the granular engine twice and play a chord (e.g., a major 3rd) with it.
