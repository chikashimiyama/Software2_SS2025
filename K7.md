# Granular Sampling and Spatialization

We have been extending granular sampling in terms of sound duration, timing, amplitude, and pitch. In this section, we discuss extending it in the spatial domain.

### Assignment 1: pan2S~
Study the [pan2S~] patch and pan the signal from [noise~].

### Assignment 2: Grain Pan
Download the [basic granular patch](K7/basic.zip). Add a slider to control the panning of the granular sound. Note that during the playback of one grain, the pan position of the grain should not be changed.

Hint: [sah~]

### Assignment 3: Random Pan
Add another slider to control the randomness of the panning position. Use [noise~] as the random number generator.

### Assignment 4: rand~ Instead of noise~
Replace [noise~] with [rand~] and observe the difference in sound.

### Assignment 5:
Extend the idea to make it compatible with an 4-channel speaker setup in the studio.

### Assignment 6:
Extend the idea to make it compatible with an 8-channel speaker setup in the studio.

Hint: Analyze the [pan2S~] patch and create [pan8S~].

### Assignment 7:
Activate more than one granular engine in one patch and move two sources individually and automatically.
