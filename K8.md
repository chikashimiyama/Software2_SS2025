## Further extensions for subtle characterization

### Explore the world of different windows
We have been using only sine window for windowing but there are many windowing techniques. We can use other windows in our granular patch as well. Each window produces slightly differen t timber.

### Assignment 1: Different windowing
Refer to the wikipedia page and implement a patch to fill a [buffer~] with a window in the page. the buffer size has to be 1024 samples.

### Assignment 2: Choose different window for each grain
Download the window wav files and patch.
Apply randomly one of those five window to each grain randomly.

### Assignment 3: Dynamic windowing
Window is in the nutschell fadein and fadeout, we can control attack and release time and dynamically control them.
- Download the template granular patch
- Add two sliders to the patch (range from 0 to 25 ms)
- control the attack and release time of the window envelope by the slider dynamically

### Assignment 4: Morphing between windows
Download the assignment patch.
There are two buffer~s that contain hann and blackmann-harris windows. crossfade those two buffers with a slider.  

### Explore the world of random generators

### Assignment 5: Apply filter to the noise~
Download the template granular patch.
Apply filter (lowpass or highpass) to the [noise~] for randomization and observe the effect of the fillter.

### Assignment 6: Apply exponential distribution
[noise~] generates equally distributed random numbers. we can apply some tendencies by applying [log].
Download the template granular patch. insert log calculation after noise~ and create exponential distribution in order to control the tendency of the randomness.

### Assignment 7: rand~ instead of noise~
[rand~] produces smooth and continuous random signal as opposed to [noise~] that generates discrete random signal.
In the template patch, replace [noise~] with [rand~] and observe the difference in sound.
