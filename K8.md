### Different Filter for Each Grain
Set up 5 different filters and send grains to one of them. The destination filters can be chosen by a slider or some random algorithm.

### Windowing
We have been using only a sine window for windowing, but we can use different [windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function). Each window produces a slightly different timbre.

### Granular + Additive Synthesis
If one granular engine plays back the same grain twice, three times, or four times as fast as another engine, it generates theoretical overtones of the original grain. Then we can control the balance of each "overtone" like additive synthesis.

### Granular Synthesis
If the grain size is very short, like 5 ms, we hear the pitch from the repetition, and the sound produced by repetition becomes more dominant than the pitch of the original sound. This means we have a continuum between a granular engine as a sampler and a synthesizer.
