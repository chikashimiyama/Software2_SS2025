## Advanced Granular with [gen~]
with [gen~] we can open further possibilities of granular sampling.

### Do we really need windowing?
In case we start the grain from 0 and end with 0. it is not necessary to apply windowing.
This means, if it is OK to that each grain have different duration.


### Do we really need complimentary engine?
We can create something like [poly~] in the audio domain in gen~ and distribute tasks.
