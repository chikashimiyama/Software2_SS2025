# Granular Sampling (3)

Currently, granular sampling sounds like "tremolo". We can further smoothen the texture of granular sound using OLA.

### OLA (Overlap and Add)
Overlap and Add (OLA) is a technique used in signal processing to reconstruct a modified signal by overlapping and summing windowed segments. It ensures smooth transitions between segments, reducing artifacts in applications like time-stretching, pitch-shifting, and granular sampling.

### Assignment 1:
Create a [phasor~ 200] and shift the phase of the generated signal by [phasor~ 200] by 180 degrees.

Hint: [trunc~]

### Assignment 2:
Download [K3 Assignment 6](K2/a6.maxpat) and make the granular sound smoother by duplicating the granular engine and applying the technique introduced in Assignment 1.

### Assignment 3:
The patch for Assignment 2 might look very complex.
Use **abstraction** for the grain playback part and simplify the patch.

### Assignment 4:
Create a quadruple OLA in which each phasor is shifted by 90 degrees and apply it to the granular patch. Compare the sound with the double OLA. Is it better?
