# Granular Sampling (5) More Ideas for extension

### Assignment 1: Duty Cycle
Download the ![basic granular sampling patch](K5/base.zip)
In the patch, the duration of grain playback is fixed to 50 msec. However, we can stop the playback at 25 msec (50%). In order to intentionally emphasize the graininess of the texture.
Add one slider to control the playback duration ratio from 0% to 100%.

### Assignment 2: Break after grain playback
Download the ![basic granular sampling patch](K5/base.zip)
We can also intentionally add some "pause" period after playback to control the density of grains. Add a slider to control the duration of "pause" period from 0 to 100 msec.

### Assignment 3: Glissando for each grain
Download the basic granular sampling patch.
Add one slider (range -100 to 100) to control the direction of glissando, if 100 the grain playback starts with normal speed and end with double speed.

### Assignment 4: Glisson granular
Based on the idea for Assignment 3, randomize the goal pitch of each grain and let the user control the goal pitch with rslider (range from -100 to 100).
