# Granular Sampling in Live Electronics

We can map the parameter of granular sampling patch to the loudness of input signal so that we can control the granular sound with another sound. 

### Assignment 1:
Download the basic granular sampling patch.
analyze the loudness of input signal from the microphone and advance the playback position based on the loudness, when it reaches the end of the buffer, jump the play position to the begginin of the buffer.


### Assignment 2:
Use the Assignment 1 patch and control one more granular parameter (randomness/pitch) using the loudness


We can also record fill the buffer in realtime and automatically start granular playback.

### Assignment 3:
Analyze the loudness of incoming signal from the microphone and send a bang to the button when a loud sound is played in front of the microphone.

### Assignment 4:
Using the system implemented in Assignment 3, automatically record 50 msec of sound, when a loud sound is played in front of the microphone.

### Assignment 5:
after the 50 msec of recording, playback the recorded sound for 10 sec with granular sampling.

### Assignment 6:
Duplicate the system and make it polyphonic.
