# Granular Sampling (5)

### Assignment 1: Duty Cycle
Download the [basic granular sampling patch](K5/base.zip).
In the patch, the duration of grain playback is fixed at 50 ms. However, we can stop the playback at 25 ms (50%) to intentionally emphasize the graininess of the texture.
Add a slider to control the playback duration ratio from 0% to 100%.

### Assignment 2: Break after Grain Playback
Download the [basic granular sampling patch](K5/base.zip).
We can also intentionally add a "pause" period after playback to control the density of grains. Add a slider to control the duration of the "pause" period from 0 to 100 ms.

### Assignment 3: Glissando for Each Grain
Download the [basic granular sampling patch](K5/base.zip).
Add a slider (range -100 to 100) to control the direction of the glissando. If set to 100, the grain playback starts at normal speed and ends at double speed.

### Assignment 4: Glisson Granular
Based on the idea for Assignment 3, randomize the goal pitch of each grain and let the user control the goal pitch with an rslider (range from -100 to 100).
