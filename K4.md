# Granular Sampling (4) 

## Automation and randomization

### Assignment 1: playback position automation
Based on the patch for [K3 assignment 2](k3/a3.zip).
Use the function object and automatically control the playback position.

### Assignment 2: playback position randomness
Based on the patch for [K3 assignment 2](k3/a3.zip).
randomize the position of playback without making click noise.
control the range of randomness by a slider (0-100 msc).

hint: [noise~]

### Assignment 3: pitch randomness
On top of Assignment 2,
randomize the pitch of each grain without making click noise.
control the range of pitch by a slider.


### Assignment 4: Apply filter to the noise~
On top of Assignment 3,
Apply filter (lowpass or highpass) to the [noise~] for randomization and observe the effect of the filter.

### Assignment 5: rand~ instead of noise~
[rand~] produces smooth and continuous random signal as opposed to [noise~] that generates discrete random signal.
In the template patch, replace [noise~] with [rand~] and observe the difference in sound.


### Assignment 6: random amplitude
Based on the patch for [K3 assignment 2](k3/a3.zip).
We can randomize not only the pitch and the playback position  but also amplitude.  
Add a slider to the patch (range 0 - 100) and randomize the amplitude of each grain. where 0 means all grains are played back at the original amplitude, 50 means that the grains are played back between 50 to 100% of the original amplitude.

### Assignment 7: drop off ratio
Based on the patch for [K3 assignment 2](k3/a3.zip).
Add one slider to the patch ranging from 0-100(%).
when the slider is 0 all grains are played back and  when 100% all grains are NOT played back. when 50%, the probability of grain playback becomes 50%.

### Assignment 8: glitch grain
Based on the patch for [K3 assignment 2](k3/a3.zip).
Add a slider to the patch (range 0-100). This slider controls the probability of grain played back one octave higher.
if the slider is at 50(%), with 50% of probability the grain is played back one octave higher.
