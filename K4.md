# Granular Sampling (4) 

## Automation and Randomization

### Assignment 1: Playback Position Automation
Based on the patch for [K3 Assignment 2](k3/a3.zip), use the function object to automatically control the playback position.

### Assignment 2: Playback Position Randomness
Based on the patch for [K3 Assignment 2](k3/a3.zip), randomize the playback position without causing click noise. Control the range of randomness with a slider (0-100 ms).

Hint: [noise~]

### Assignment 3: Pitch Randomness
Building on Assignment 2, randomize the pitch of each grain without causing click noise. Control the range of pitch with a slider.

### Assignment 4: Apply Filter to the Noise~
Building on Assignment 3, apply a filter (lowpass or highpass) to the [noise~] for randomization and observe the effect of the filter.

### Assignment 5: rand~ Instead of noise~
[rand~] produces a smooth and continuous random signal, as opposed to [noise~], which generates a discrete random signal. In the patch, replace [noise~] with [rand~] and observe the difference in sound.

### Assignment 6: Random Amplitude
Based on the patch for [K3 Assignment 2](k3/a3.zip), we can randomize not only the pitch and playback position but also the amplitude. Add a slider to the patch (range 0-100) to randomize the amplitude of each grain. A value of 0 means all grains are played back at the original amplitude, while 50 means the grains are played back between 50% to 100% of the original amplitude.

### Assignment 7: Drop-off Ratio
Based on the patch for [K3 Assignment 2](k3/a3.zip), add a slider to the patch ranging from 0-100%. When the slider is at 0, all grains are played back; at 100%, no grains are played back. At 50%, the probability of grain playback is 50%.

### Assignment 8: Introducing Irregularity
Based on the patch for [K3 Assignment 2](k3/a3.zip), add a slider to the patch (range 0-100). This slider controls the probability of a grain being played back one octave higher. If the slider is at 50%, there is a 50% probability that the grain is played back one octave higher.
