# Granular Sampling in Live Electronics

## parameter control
We can map the parameter of granular sampling patch to the loudness of input signal so that we can control the granular sound with another sound.

### Assignment 1:
Download [the basic granular sampling patch](K6/base.zip).
analyze the loudness of input signal from the microphone and advance the playback position based on the loudness.

### Assignment 2:
Use the Assignment 1 patch and control one more granular parameter (randomness/pitch) using the loudness

## realtime sampling
We can also record fill the buffer in realtime and automatically start granular playback.

### Assignment 3:
Analyze the loudness of incoming signal from the microphone and send a bang to the button when a loud sound is played in front of the microphone.

### Assignment 4:
Using the system implemented in Assignment 3, automatically record 50 msec of sound, when a loud sound is played in front of the microphone.

### Assignment 5:
after the 50 msec of recording, playback the recorded sound for 1 sec with granular sampling with fade-in and fade-out. 

### Assignment 6:
Apply more dynamism to granular playback.

### Assignment 7:
make the system polyphonic in which during the granular playback, a new sound 50 msec samples can be captured and played back simultaneously.
