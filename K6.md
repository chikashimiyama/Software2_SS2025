# Granular Sampling in Live Electronics

## Parameter Control
We can map the parameters of a granular sampling patch to the loudness of an input signal so that we can control the granular sound with another sound.

### Assignment 1:
Download [the basic granular sampling patch](K6/base.zip).
Analyze the loudness of the input signal from the microphone and advance the playback position based on the loudness.

Hint: [average~]

### Assignment 2:
Using the patch from Assignment 1, control one more granular parameter (randomness/pitch) using the loudness.

## Realtime Sampling
We can also fill the buffer in real-time and automatically start granular playback.

### Assignment 3:
Analyze the loudness of the incoming signal from the microphone and send a bang to a [button] when a loud sound is detected.

### Assignment 4:
Using the system implemented in Assignment 3, automatically record 50 ms of sound when a loud sound is detected.

### Assignment 5:
After recording 50 ms of sound, play back the recorded sound for 1 second with granular sampling, including fade-in and fade-out.

Hint: [line~]

### Assignment 6:
Apply more dynamism to the granular playback.

Hint: graininess change. pitch deviation etc.

### Assignment 7:
Make the system polyphonic so that during granular playback, new 50 ms samples can be captured and played back simultaneously.

Hint: abstraction with #0 helps
