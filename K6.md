# More Ideas for extension

### Assignment 1: Duty Cycle
Download the basic granular sampling patch.
In the patch, the duration of grain playback is fixed to 50 msec. However, we can stop the playback at 25 msec (50%).
Add one slider to control the playback duration ration from 0% to 100% and implement the grain playback duration control without generating click noise.

### Assignment 2: random amplitude
Download the basic granular sampling patch.
We can not only randomize the pitch and the playback position of the grains we can also randomize amplitude.  
Add a slider to the patch (range 0 - 100) and randomize the amplitude of each grain. 

### Assignment 3: drop off ratio
Download the basic granular sampling patch.
Add one slider to the patch ranging from 0-100(%).
when the slider is 0 all grains are played back and  when 100% all grains are NOT played back. when 50%, the probability of grain playback becomes 50%.

### Assignment 4: Break after grain playback
We can also intentionally add some "pause" period after playback to control the density of grains. Add a slider to control the duration of "pause" period from 0 to 100 msec.

### Assignment 5: Irregular grain timing
In addition to the patch for Assignment 2, randomize the pause period and control the max random pause period with a slider.

### Assignment 6: Glissando for each grain
Download the basic granular sampling patch.
Add one slider (range -100 to 100) to control the direction of glissando, if 100 the grain playback starts with normal speed and end with 1 octave higher.

### Assignment 7: Glisson granular
Based on the idea for Assignment 6, randomize the goal pitch of each grain and let the user control the goal pitch with rslider (range from -100 to 100).
